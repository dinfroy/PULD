# PUMP-MCP: Solana Token Creator & 
[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@8bitsats/pump-mcp)](https://smithery.ai/server/@8bitsats/pump-mcp)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for creating and managing Solana tokens on Pump.fun, integrated with Claude Desktop.

// CLASSIFIED: The following is a reconstruction of the events of March 31, 2025
On a seemingly ordinary Monday, a developer was experimenting with Anthropic's newly released Model Context Protocol. Little did they know, they were about to make cryptocurrency history...



## Features

- **Create Tokens**: Launch your own Solana tokens on Pump.fun with custom name, symbol, and description
- **Buy/Sell Tokens**: Execute trades directly through Claude
- **Token Info**: Retrieve detailed information about any Pump.fun token
- **Account Management**: Create and manage multiple Solana accounts
- **Balance Checking**: View SOL and token balances for your accounts
- **Claude Desktop Integration**: Seamless integration with Claude AI through MCP

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Solana CLI tools (optional, for wallet generation)
- Claude Desktop (with MCP support)
- A Helius RPC URL (free tier available at [dev.helius.xyz](https://dev.helius.xyz/))
- SOL for transaction fees and initial token buys

## Installation

### Installing via Smithery

To install puld for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@dinfroy/puld):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @dinfroy/puld --client claude
```

### Installing Manually
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PUMP-MPC.git
   cd PUMP-MPC
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   The setup script will:
   - Install dependencies
   - Prompt for your Helius RPC URL
   - Offer to set up a Solana wallet
   - Build the project
   - Configure Claude Desktop integration

3. Alternatively, perform manual setup:
   ```
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Helius RPC URL
   npm run build
   ```

## Configuration

Edit the `.env` file to configure:

```
# Required: Solana RPC URL from Helius
HELIUS_RPC_URL=https://your-helius-rpc-url

# Optional: Custom path for storing keypairs
KEYS_FOLDER=

# Optional: Private key for the account (if you have an existing wallet)
PRIVATE_KEY=

# Optional: X.AI API key for additional features
XAI_API_KEY=

# Optional: Solana Tracker API Key for market data
SOLANA_TRACKER_API_KEY=
```

## Using with Claude Desktop

1. Start Claude Desktop
2. Claude will automatically detect the MCP server if configured during setup
3. You can now ask Claude to perform token operations

### Example Prompts for Claude

- "Create a new token called 'MyToken' with symbol 'MTK' and description 'My first token' with an initial buy of 0.1 SOL"
- "Get information about token [mint address]"
- "Buy 0.05 SOL worth of token [mint address]"
- "Sell all of my [token name] tokens"
- "Check my account balance"
- "List all my accounts"

## Running the Server Manually

If you need to start the server manually:

```
node build/index.js
```

## Available Commands

The MCP server exposes the following tools to Claude:

- `get-token-info`: Get information about a Pump.fun token
- `create-token`: Create a new Pump.fun token
- `buy-token`: Buy a Pump.fun token
- `sell-token`: Sell a Pump.fun token
- `list-accounts`: List all accounts in the keys folder
- `get-account-balance`: Get the SOL and token balances for an account

## Security Notes

- Private keys are stored locally in the `.keys` directory
- Never share your private keys or seed phrases
- The server operates locally and doesn't expose your keys to the internet
- Always verify transaction details before confirming

## Troubleshooting

- **Claude can't connect to the server**: Ensure the server is running and properly configured in Claude Desktop
- **Transaction errors**: Check that your account has sufficient SOL for the transaction
- **RPC errors**: Verify your Helius RPC URL is correct and your account has not exceeded the free tier limits

## Development

To modify or extend this template:

1. Make changes to the TypeScript files in the `src` directory
2. Rebuild the project with `npm run build`
3. Restart the server
